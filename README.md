This MelonLoader mod is a fork of [AISomniumFiles2Fix](https://github.com/Lyall/AISomniumFiles2Fix) for the game **AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES - nirvanA Initiative** extends support of it by:
- Fixing the black bar issue on 16:10 resolutions, specifically the steam deck (possibly this fixes issues for other reso's but untested)
- Scaling the UI acordingly (will apeare slightly stretched, but unless you know, you dont really see it)
